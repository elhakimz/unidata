Business Process Management
----------------------------

For Data operation process, which only perform  simple data operation like
adding Contacts, Definitions, Types, the process will use @Service call which
act as a proxy or decorator.

While 'complex' operations , for example Employment, Termination, Purchasing, Contract agreement etc which needs
more than simple steps and variables like time, manual operation and approval in business logic
BPM will be used,  currently Activiti BPM is more Developer friendly and had good integration
with Spring eco-system , rather than other BPM Package like JBPM or Bonita.

The process itself will be defined using BPMN (Business Process Management Notation)
